    <h2>Description</h2>
    This rich and flavorful ramen broth combines the robust flavors of pork knuckle and chicken bones, 
    simmered for hours with a whole head of garlic, sweet apple, and aromatic vegetables to create a deeply 
    satisfying base. Unblanched pork bones add a bold character, while cleaned chicken bones keep the stock 
    balanced and smooth. This recipe yields a luscious, slightly cloudy broth with a full-bodied mouthfeel, perfect 
    for pairing with classic Japanese tare seasonings like shoyu, miso, or shio. Add a dash of 
    fragrant aromatic oil, such as black garlic or green onion oil, to elevate the flavors and 
    create an unforgettable bowl of ramen.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li> げんこつ (pork knuckle): 1.5–2 kg (unblanched)</li>
       <li> 鶏ガラ (chicken bones): 2 kg, innards and excess blood vessels removed</li>
       <li> 玉ねぎ (onion): 1 whole onion, halved</li>
       <li> ねぎ (green onion): 1 large stalk, roughly chopped</li>
       <li> ニンニク (garlic): 1 whole head, cloves left unpeeled</li>
       <li> 豚ミンチ (ground pork): 200–300 grams</li>
       <li> リンゴ (apple): 1 medium apple, cut into chunks</li>
       <li> 昆布 (kombu): 10–15 cm piece</li>
       <li> Water: 6 liters</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Prepare the Chicken Bones: Remove any innards and excess blood  vessels from the chicken bones. This step helps keep the flavor clean and prevents bitterness.</li>

        <li>Start the Stock: Place the pork knuckle and prepared chicken bones in a large pot, 
            cover with 6 liters of fresh water, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a gentle simmer.</li>

        <li>Add Ingredients: Add the halved onion, whole garlic head, 
            green onion, ground pork, apple, and kombu to the pot.</li>

        <li>Simmer: Keep at a low simmer for 6–8 hours, skimming off any impurities  
            that rise to the surface as the pork bones release flavors and fats. The longer simmer will bring out a richer flavor and texture.</li>

        <li>Strain: Remove and discard the solids, then strain the broth through a 
            fine-mesh strainer for a full-bodied, slightly cloudy, robust stock.</li>
    </ol>
