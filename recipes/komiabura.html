    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
    <p class="description"> This 香味油 will add a deep, savory aroma to your ramen, with balanced notes of 
    garlic, ginger, and onion. Use a ~15ml per bowl of ramen for an added layer of 
    richness and fragrance.</p>

    <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>ラード (lard): 200 ml</li>
        <li>ニンニク (garlic): 3 cloves, sliced thinly</li>
        <li>生姜 (ginger): 20 grams, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>ネギ (green onion): 1 large stalk, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>玉ねぎ (onion): 1/4 medium onion, thinly sliced
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        
        <li>Heat the Lard: In a small saucepan, add the lard and heat over low-medium heat until 
        it begins to melt and warm up.</li>

        <li>Add Aromatics: Once the lard is warm (but not too hot), add 
        the garlic, ginger, green onion, and onion.</li>
    
        <li>Cook Slowly: Keep the heat low and allow the aromatics to slowly 
        infuse the lard, stirring occasionally. Continue cooking until the garlic and onion 
        become golden brown and slightly crispy. This can take about 10–15 minutes, depending 
        on the heat.</li>
    
        <li>Strain: Remove from heat and let cool slightly. Strain the oil through a fine mesh 
            sieve into a heatproof jar or container, discarding the solids.</li>
    
        <li>Store: Let the oil cool completely before sealing. Store in the refrigerator for up to a week.</li>
    </ol>
